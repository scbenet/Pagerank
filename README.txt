Designed for use with a modified version of the wikilinks dataset produced as a collaboration
between Google and the UMass Computer Science department. Dataset used in this project was a subset 
of the original dataset, containing roughly 1.4 million unique wikipedia pages. File used not included 
here as its size (even compressed) is more than double the github upload limit.

Original dataset can be found [here](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/data/data-wiki-links) or [here](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/wiki-links)
